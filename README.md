# Team UGM-Indonesia 2023 Wiki

This repository **MUST** contain all coding assets to generate your team's wiki (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc).

Images, photos, icons and fonts **MUST** be stored on `static.igem.wiki` using [uploads.igem.org](https://uploads.igem.org), and Videos **must** be embedded from [iGEM Video Universe](https://video.igem.org).

For up-to-date requirements, resources, help and guidance, visit [competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki).

## Getting started

You should probably only edit the files inside folders `static`, `wiki` and `wiki > pages`.
1. Open the Web IDE
1. Make the changes on the files you wish:
    * For the menu, change the file [menu.html](wiki/menu.html)
    * For the layout, change the file [layout.html](wiki/layout.html)
    * For the pages, change the corresponding file in the foler [pages](wiki/pages)
1. Review the changes you made
1. Once you are done, save the changes by **committing** them to the *main branch* of the repository
1. An automated script will build, test and deploy your wiki, which should take less than 30 seconds.

## About this Template

### Files

The static assets are in the `static` directory. The layout and templates are in the `wiki` directory, and the pages live in the `wiki > pages` directory. Unless you are an experienced and/or adventurous human, you probably shouldn't change other files.

    |__ static/             -> static assets (CSS and JavaScript files only)
    |__ wiki/               -> Main directory for the pages and layouts
        |__ footer.html     -> Footer that will appear in all the pages
        |__ layout.html     -> Main layout of your wiki. All the pages will follow its structure
        |__ menu.html       -> Menu that will appear in all the pages
        |__ pages/          -> Directory for all the pages
            |__ *.html      -> Actual pages of your wiki
    |__ .gitignore          -> Tells GitLab which files/directories should not be uploaded to the repository
    |__ .gitlab-ci.yml      -> Automated flow for building, testing and deploying your website.
    |__ LICENSE             -> License CC-by-4.0, all wikis are required to have this license - DO NOT MODIFY
    |__ README.md           -> File containing the text you are reading right now
    |__ app.py              -> Python code managing your wiki
    |__ dependencies.txt    -> Software dependencies from the Python code

### Technologies

### Building locally (advanced users)

To work locally with this project, follow the steps below:

#### Install
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.igem.org/2023/ugm-indonesia.git
cd ugm-indonesia
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate # on Linux, MacOS; or
. venv\Scripts\activate # on Windows
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

#### Execute
```bash
python app.py
```
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
